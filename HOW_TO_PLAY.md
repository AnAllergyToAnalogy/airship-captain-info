### Native to Farcaster and Arbitrum

#### A game by AnAllergyToAnalogy

### How to Play

Airship Captain must be played in a Farcaster Frame. Post this link to your timetline to get an embedded frame 
 [https://airship-captain.netlify.app/api/](https://airship-captain.netlify.app/api/). Note: as a bonus, if anyone 
  plays using a Frame you have embedded, you will earn royalties from any missions they complete.

## AVIATE

The Aviate screen allows you to manually control your airship. You can set the Heading (direction), and turn the Throttle on and off.

Be aware of the Wind. It changes direction and speed about every 15 minutes, and having a tail wind can be very useful.

## NAVIGATE

The Navigate screen helps you plan your journey. Click MAP to see where you are on the world map. You can see any 
 Locations you have encountered, as well as seeing any rival Airships around you. Maybe they know where some good 
  Resources are?

You can also enable and disable EXPLORE MODE. When enabled, if your ship sees a new location it hasn't encountered before
 it will autopilot to that destination. It means you don't have to be constantly refreshing if you want to explore.

The LOCATIONS submenu lets you pick locations for your Autopilot. You can navigate straight to Home Base, the nearest 
Location, or pick from a list of known Locations.

## CARGO

The Cargo screen is where you can see any cargo you are carrying. It is also where you go to view Resources if you are 
 at a location to decide if they are worth picking up. You also use this screen to sell your cargo at Home Base, and to 
  collect any royalties earned from people playing in your frame.

## UPGRADE

The Upgrade screen is where you can spend Coin upgrade your ship.

You can upgrade your Airship in 3 different ways:

1. Engines (makes it go faster)
2. Fuel (makes it travel longer without running out of fuel)
3. Cargo (means you can carry more stuff back on a mission)

## Out of Fuel

If you run out of fuel, you have two options. You can Abandon your cargo and instantly return to base. Or you can pay 
 Coin for an emergency rescue. 

## BUGS

This is very much a Beta release, if not earlier. Please report any bugs to me on Farcaster:
