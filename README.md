### Native to Farcaster and Arbitrum

[Airship Captain](https://airship-captain.netlify.app/api/) is a free-to-play mini MMORPG that runs exclusively in a Farcaster Frame, with a native game currency on the Arbitrum 
 network. It was made in just over a week for the "Frame It" Arbitrum x Farcaster Buildathon.

The objective of the game is to explore the world in your Airship and find resources to bring them back to Home Base, 
 where you can then sell them for Airship Captain Coins (ACC). 

You can spend these Coins on upgrades for your Airship, or for emergency refuelling.

This game is very much a work in progress but this hackathon had a deadline. I will be polishing it over the coming 
 days, and if there is interest in the game I have some features I would like to add.

### Gameplay

Players can manually control their Airship by setting the heading and throttle, or by directing the autopilot to go to a
 location they have already encountered.

Once at a location, a player can collect cargo if they have space in their Airship. They can then return to Home Base 
 to sell their cargo, but be careful not to go too far or your Airship will run out of fuel. Airships automatically 
  refuel for free at the Home Base.

Airship travel is designed to be compatible with the limitations of the Farcaster Frame interface. Since the frames 
 can not refresh automatically, and the response time is not instantaneous, it can take several minutes to travel 
  between locations. Players can see their surroundings on the MAP screen located on the NAVIGATE menu.

When a player takes Resources from a Location, the amount of Resources at that location will be depleted, meaning there 
 is less for other players to take. Resources regenerate slowly, but the rarer the resource the slower it regenerates 
  (but the more valuable it is!)

To get started just open the game and turn the throttle on!

### Airship Captain Coin

Players earn and spend Coins by completing missions and buying upgrades or emergency fuel. The Coin is an ERC20 token 
 on the Arbitrum network. 

#### Finders Fees (referrals)

Players can also earn Coin by sharing the game on their timeline. If someone is playing the game in a Frame you have 
 posted, you will get an additional 10% Finders Fee from any Cargo they sell. You can withdraw these coins when you are 
  at Home Base.


### Upgrades

You can upgrade your Airship in 3 different ways:

1. Engines (makes it go faster)
2. Fuel (makes it travel longer without running out of fuel)
3. Cargo (means you can carry more stuff back on a mission)
